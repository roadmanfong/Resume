# Introduction

## Short Self introduction

Nice to meet you {}. Thank you for giving me the opportunity.

My name is 方光輝. You can just call me by my English name, Steven

> I graduated from Chengchi University majored in Mathematics.
> I had a master degree at the Central University where I majored in Communication engineering.

I’ve been working as a frontend Engineer for eight years.

At my current job in the startup company, named Chelpis. I am responsible for all the frontend including web, mobile app and desktop app.
In Chelpis, We provided cryptography solution like cryptocurrencies and crypto-algorithms.
Besides it, We also offer app design and development to our client.
For example, we have a co-working space management system, you can book a meeting room online, or unlock entrance door.
A Conference App that you can check the agenda or show the qr code ticket.
A Pain scale app, so the patient can log and track the pain
Usually we need to build both web and native app even the desktop app, so we leverage React and React Native on all the projects.

I have always enjoyed working with people and being engaged in problem solving.

Although I love my current role, I feel I’m now ready for a more challenging assignment and this position really excites me.

That is my introduction, thank you!

## 興趣

I like to travel. I can escape from my daily routine. See things in the different way. Recently, I went skiing in Naeba in Japan

## What are your strength?

I'm Highly-motivated and reliable person.
I'm eager to learn new things.
I check twitter and github trending project from time to time to see if there is anything interesting.

## Why did you leave your last job

As a startup company. we always have to deliver production on tight deadlines.
To me, the result is the compromise between quality and speed,
However I'd like to go further to make production better and better.

### for Quanta

I was in the department called Future Lab.
I’ve gained a lot of experience
 We build many projects but only few of them really become product. I think you can learn things only when you put the things in the market.

### for A10Networks

side project called Workgenius. It's an in-house knowledge management system. build with react, graphql, rethinkdb, express.js.

I applied this job for migration from Angular to React.js.
So we build the unit test for angular and new react component so that we can have more confidence refactor code.
And we have some reusable component sharing between different team.

For some reason we still use svn as version control tool, and svn is really not a good tool for rapid development.


## Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Hopefully, in 5 years I will see myself in a more senior position, working for a company that allows me to grow within it.

## What is your weakness

Well, my attention to details rather than the big picture sometimes slow down the progress. I’ve been striving to improve in this area by checking in with myself at regular intervals and giving myself a chance to re-focusing on the bigger picture.

## Why should I hire you rather than someone else?

I'm Highly Motivated And Eager To Learn New Things
My skill set would be a perfect match for what you’re looking for.

## What are three positive things your last boss would say about you

My boss is actually my colleague in Quanta.
He said after he saw me programing he said he won't program any more

I thinks it would flexible, committed and communicative.

## Tell me a difficult problem you had to solve.

The CoolbitX, is one of our client.
They have a credit card-sized Bluetooth hardware wallet.
They already have one react native hybrid app, My job is to rewrite it with fully react native.
The difficult part is this is my first time to do bluetooth, and they have some non standard protocol.
they have good document, but few comment on the code.
So I have to console log every where to figure out whole picture.
Check with them back and forth

## Do you have any questions

* What are your concerns about my candidacy?
* Can I choose the workplace? Is it still remote now?
* what is the structure of frontend engineer team

## Ambitions

I want to make the world better place, To accomplish this, join the Facebook is the best option.
Facebook change the world with fantastic app and technology. I want grow with it and to be a part of it.
